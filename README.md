# AngularJS Github Viewer

### Example app for learning angular.

Does about 2% of what the github UI does.  Reads Github API to show user and repository info.

The main page has a timer for no good reason.  This is the project from the Pluralsight course *Angular JS: Get Started*.

### Setup

- You'll need to edit `js/services/github.js` and set your Github username and password so the app can authenticate with the Github API.

### Run

- Just stick all the files in an app server.  Nothing fancy needed, the backend is Github.
